# IT-TESQUA
The system/app that I am going to create is the RAW MASTER.
Raw master or the online meat selling in which the system will only cater fresh meat like,
chicken meat, pork, fish and more that is 100% fresh from the local farmer.
In this start up system I created the HOME SCREEN, CONTACT US,SERVICES,PROGRAM AND THE PRODUCTS.
this is not 100% done, yet the product that is already created is alrready visible yet undone.
In CONTACT US page I added my contact number and email address visible for the upcomming user and also some photos to be seen.
In PRODUCT page I have'nt put any photos as of the moment but soon I will input some image of a fresh meat with the corresponding amount and more.
In SERVICE page I included the following : BOOKING ORDERS,CANCEL ORDERS,REFUND SERVICES,DELIVERY SERVICE,REDELIVERY SERVICES and DISCOUNT SERVICE.
Lastly in PROGRAM PAGE it will be updated if there will be an upcomming program or event and so as of the moment I just input Monthly discount
which is upto 20% and ANNIVERSARY which can give upto 50% of discount specially for those loyal user and customer.
